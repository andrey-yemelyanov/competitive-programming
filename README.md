# Competitive programming
My solutions to programming problems on [UVA Online Judge](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/).

If you also want to get started with programming challenges I would highly recommend that you study using [Competitive Programming 3](https://cpbook.net/). This excellent book covers all the important algorithms that you need to know in order to be successful in your competitive programming career. Not only that, it will actually make a much better programmer and a problem solver out of you.

Should you wish to try solving problems using UVA, I recommend using [JUva](https://github.com/andrey-yemelyanov/uva-utility) - a command-line tool I wrote that allows you to manage your solutions and submit them to UVA directly without using a browser.
